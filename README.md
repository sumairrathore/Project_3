# Project 3 Fifa Analytics
Yumi Kim, Shoaib Khan, Sumair Rathore, Olivia Bryant

## Project Proposal:
The aim of our project is to create a Sports Analytics Dashboard that provides users with statistics and visualizations for sports data, such as player performance, team rankings, and game outcomes. The dashboard will allow users to explore and analyze the data based on different filters, enabling them to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.

The dashboard page will include multiple charts that update from the same data, providing users with a comprehensive view of the sports analytics. We will utilize a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and a database (e.g., SQL, MongoDB, SQLite) to develop an interactive and informative dashboard.

Our group aims to deliver an engaging and informative Sports Analytics Dashboard that provides users with valuable insights into player performance, team rankings, and game outcomes.

## Data Source:
[Kaggle Fifa 20 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset?select=players_20.csv)

## Collaboration and Timeline:
To ensure effective collaboration, we will establish communication channels such as Slack and determine each group memberâ€™s working hours for efficient coordination. We will use GitHub Projects to track tasks, set milestones with due dates, and monitor progress.

The proposed timeline for completing the project is as follows:
1. Project ideation and proposal development.
2. Data sourcing and integration from reliable sports datasets.
3. Database setup and data storage.
4. Data exploration, cleaning, and analysis in Jupyter notebooks.
5. Development of Flask-powered API to serve the analyzed data.
6. Implementation of HTML/CSS and JavaScript for interactive visualizations.
7. Integration of a JavaScript library for enhanced visualizations and user interaction.
8. Creation of the dashboard page with multiple charts.
9. Implementation of user-driven interactions and customization options.
10. Testing, debugging, and refining the project.
11. Documentation and preparation for the group presentation.
